Takes event in and forwards them to various places.

You can send events to Forwardlytics, and it will forward it to many services like [Intercom][intercom] or [Mixpanel][mixpanel].

**THIS IS A VERY VERY EARLY NON WORKING VERSION**. Use at your own risk, or contribute :)

Where are we at? What needs to be done and what's in the pipeline? See [Forawrdlytics on waffle.io][forwardlytics-on-waffle]

## Installation

- `go get github.com/jipiboily/forwardlytics`

- set `FORWARDLYTICS_API_KEY=SOMETHING_YOU_DECIDE_AND_NO_ONE_CAN_GUESS`

To send to Intercom:
- set `INTERCOM_API_KEY=123`
- set `INTERCOM_APP_ID=456`

[Mixpanel][mixpanel], [Drip][drip] and [Keen.io][keen.io] are probably going to be next.

## Deployment

Forwardlytics can be deployed to [Heroku][heroku]. You can setup the port it starts on by setting the `PORT` environment variable.

## Error tracking

Right Forwardlytics supports tracking error via Bugsnag. Thanks to Logrus, it's pretty easy to add any other bug tracker. PRs welcome.

### Bugsnag config

To enable Bugsnag, set those environment variables:

```
BUGSNAG_API_KEY=your-api-key-123
ENVIRONMENT=development
```

If the environment is not set, it'll work but defaults to `development`.

## You need an integration that doesn't exist yet?

You have two options:

- send a PR adding it.
- get in touch to have it added by the author (for a fee).

## Calling the API

cURL example:

```
curl --request POST \
--header "Content-Type: application/json" \
--header "Forwardlytics-Api-Key: 123ma" \
-d '{"userID":"123", "userTraits":{"number_of_things":"42"},"timestamp":1459532831}' http://localhost:3000/identify
```

See [./integration/integration.go][integration.go] for details of what is accepted by the API.

## Development

Note that you should install [Godep][godep] if you are going to add any dependency to this project.

- `FORWARDLYTICS_API_KEY=somevalue go run main.go`

If you want auto reloading, install [codegangsta/gin][codegangsta/gin] and run:

- `FORWARDLYTICS_API_KEY=somevalue gin -a 8080 -t .`

You need to set environment variables for the integrations you want to work with.
